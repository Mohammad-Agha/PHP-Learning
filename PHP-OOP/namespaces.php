/*
Namespaces are qualifiers that solve two different problems:
    1. They allow for better organization by grouping classes that work together to perform a task.
    2. They allow the same name to be used for more than one class.

Namespaces MUST declared at the beginning of a file using the 'namespace' keyword
Everything declared in this file will belong to that namespace
It's possible to have nested namespaces
